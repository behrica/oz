    * `:as-assets?` - Pass through as a static assets (for images, css, json or edn data, etc)

  Additional options pertinent to the entire build process may be passed in:
    * `:live?` - Watch the file files 
    * `:lazy?` - If true, don't build anything until it changes; this is best for interactive/incremental updates and focused work.

    * `:view?` - Build with live view of most recently changed file (default true)
    * `:root-dir` - Static assets will be served relative to this directory (defaults to greatest-common-path between all paths)
